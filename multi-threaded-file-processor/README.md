## Introduction

A **Multi-threaded File Processor** is a high-performance software system designed to process large files efficiently by leveraging parallel computing. Traditional file processing reads and processes files sequentially, which can be slow for large datasets. This system breaks files into smaller chunks and processes them concurrently across multiple threads, significantly improving throughput and performance while maintaining data integrity through proper synchronization mechanisms.

- Remove duplicate entries based on configurable strategies
- Sort final dataset according to specified criteria
- Maintain data consistency during aggregation

**Key Methods:**
- `mergeResults()` - Combine partial results

- `sortData()` - Order final results

### 4. OutputWriter
**Responsibilities:**
- Write consolidated results to output files
- Format output according to specifications
- Generate processing summaries and reports
- Manage output directory structure

**Key Methods:**
- `writeToFile()` - Save processed data
- `formatOutput()` - Structure output format

### 5. Configuration & Management
**Supporting Components:**
- `ProcessorConfig` - System configuration parameters
- `ThreadPoolManager` - Thread pool management
- `ProcessingPipeline` - Main workflow coordination

## Component Interactions

The system components interact through a well-defined pipeline:

```
FileReader 
    | (produces chunks)
ThreadPool Manager 
    | (distributes to threads)
DataProcessor (multiple instances)
    | (produces partial results)
ResultAggregator
    | (produces final dataset)
OutputWriter
    | (generates output files)
File System
```

### Interaction Details:
- **FileReader -> ThreadPool**: Chunks are submitted as callable tasks
- **ThreadPool -> DataProcessor**: Tasks are executed in parallel threads
- **DataProcessor -> Aggregator**: Processed results are collected thread-safely
- **Aggregator -> OutputWriter**: Final results are passed for output generation
